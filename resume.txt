SUMMARY:

  Software Engineer with over five years of experience developing high
  performance, scalable applications.  Insatiable learner who enjoys exploring
  datascapes and solving challenging problems.


GOALS:

  TO LEARN:  I love learning new algorithms.  I love learning new idioms,
  encountering new dialects and discovering new approaches.  I get up to speed
  quickly, and improve constantly.

  TO TEACH:  When I learn something cool, I can't wait to tell someone about
  it.  Teaching something helps me really understand it.  I share my expertise
  and help improve the skills of everyone I work with.

  TO EXPLORE:  This is the best kind of learning.  Some of my most useful
  (and rewarding) projects have grown from small tools I've written out of
  curiosity.


PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:

  Experian CheetahMail                                          (2004-present)

  Software Engineer -> Senior Software Engineer -> Tech Lead
  
  Designed and led development of the mailing, content and export subsystems
  for "next generation" email marketing platform.  Incorporated technical
  lessons learned from the first generation as well as client input.  Produced
  modular, extensible components that are approachable for new developers.

  Wrote an automatic long-term load monitoring tool for the bulk data import
  process out of curiosity.  Four years later this tool continues to serve as
  an important window into trends in client activity.

  Built a data import batch scheduler to maximize throughput for large jobs,
  minimize latency for small jobs and ensure fairness across clients.
  This scheduler is now also used for bulk subscription management and query
  execution.

  Wrote tools to explore data produced by next generation application out of
  curiosity.  These tools now form the foundation of the new production
  reporting system.

  Acted as a "testing evangelist", encouraging simultaneous development of
  unit tests with features and challenging the assertion that a bug fix is
  complete when there's no accompanying regression test.

  Gave technical presentations on topics including character sets and
  encodings, handling large datasets with limited resources and managing
  concurrency in long-running processes.

OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS:

  Gnu Coreutils / Gnulib

  Significantly improved the performance of the join utility by reducing
  memory management overhead.

  Reconciled two divergent base64 encoding libraries to make the performance
  improvements and features from each available to the other, and to reduce
  duplication of effort.

  Improved the flexibility of the sort utility by exposing control over
  algorithm selection to the user and removing limits imposed by calling
  convention.

  Perl 5 (core)

  Fixed bugs both of my own discovery and from the bug tracking system.  

  Improved the performance of the split operation in scalar context by
  reducing memory management overhead.


RELATED SKILLS:

  OS: I prefer Linux.  I can learn anything.

  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: Professional experience with Perl, C and JavaScript.
                         Hobby projects in Ruby, Erlang and Java.
                         Desire and ability to learn many others.

  QUERY, MARKUP, OBJECT NOTATION LANGUAGES: SQL, HTML, XML, JSON.

  TOOLS: svn, git, gcc, make, screen, vim, bash.


EDUCATION:

  B.A. in Computer Science from Kalamazoo College.

  One year Japan Study program at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.


OTHER INTERESTS:

  I read constantly.  I study Chinese.  I've played ping pong in clubs in the
  US and China.  I commuted over the Brooklyn Bridge and through New York
  traffic by bicycle for two years, and loved it.  I washed, fueled and
  serviced small aircraft at a local airport in high school to pay for flight
  lessons and earned my pilot's license when I was seventeen.  I like to hike
  and to rock climb, to play frisbee and to canoe.  I like card games and board
  games (and word games, too).
