SUMMARY:

  Software Engineer with over five years of experience developing high
  performance, scalable applications.  Insatiable learner who enjoys exploring
  datascapes and solving challenging problems.


APPROACH:

  I love to learn, so I get up to speed quickly and improve constantly.  I love
  to teach, so I share my knowledge and help improve the skills of everyone I
  work with.  I love to explore, so I come up with techniques and build tools
  for fun that increase productivity and, sometimes, grow into unexpectedly
  useful solutions.


PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE:

  Experian CheetahMail                                          (2004-present)

  Software Engineer -> Senior Software Engineer -> Tech Lead
  
  Designed and led development of the mailing, content and export subsystems
  for "next generation" email marketing platform.  Incorporated technical
  lessons learned from the first generation as well as client input.  Produced
  modular, extensible components that are approachable for new developers.

  Wrote an automatic long-term load monitoring tool for the bulk data import
  process out of curiosity.  Four years later this tool continues to serve as
  an important window into trends in client activity.

  Built a data import batch scheduler to maximize throughput for large jobs,
  minimize latency for small jobs and ensure fairness across clients.
  This scheduler is now also used for bulk subscription management and query
  execution.

  Wrote, out of curiosity, tools to explore data produced by next generation
  application.  These tools now form the foundation of the new production
  reporting system.

  Acted as a "testing evangelist", encouraging simultaneous development of
  unit tests with features and challenging the assertion that a bug fix is
  complete when there's no accompanying regression test.

  Gave technical presentations to audiences of up to fifty software engineers
  on topics including character sets and encodings, handling large datasets
  with limited resources and managing concurrency in long-running processes.

  Intern

  Went in, not knowing Perl, with the understanding that I would have an
  unpaid internship.  Went back to school two months later with a hefty check
  and a job offer.  Built a templatized content system for email campaigns
  that's still in use today.

OPEN SOURCE CONTRIBUTIONS:

  GNU COREUTILS / GNULIB:

  Significantly improved the performance of the join utility by reducing
  memory management overhead.

  Reconciled two divergent base64 encoding libraries to make the performance
  improvements and features from each available to the other, and to reduce
  duplication of effort.

  Improved the flexibility of the sort utility by exposing control over
  algorithm selection to the user and removing limits imposed by calling
  convention.

  PERL 5 (CORE):

  Fixed bugs both of my own discovery and from the bug tracking system.  

  Improved the performance of the split operation in scalar context by
  reducing memory management overhead.


RELATED SKILLS:

  OS: I prefer Linux.  I can learn anything.

  PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES: Professional experience with Perl, C and JavaScript.
                         Hobby projects in Ruby, Erlang and Java.
                         Desire and ability to learn many others.

  QUERY, MARKUP, OBJECT NOTATION LANGUAGES: SQL, HTML, XML, JSON.

  TOOLS: svn, git, gcc, gdb, valgrind, make, screen, vim, bash.


EDUCATION:

  B.A. in Computer Science from Kalamazoo College.               (2000-2004)

  Japan Study program at Waseda University in Tokyo, Japan.      (2002-2003)

  Senior thesis: Technical considerations for internet applications in China.


OTHER INTERESTS:

  I read constantly.  I study Chinese.  I've played ping pong in clubs in the
  US and China.  I commuted over the Brooklyn Bridge and through New York City
  traffic by bicycle for two years, and loved it.  I washed, fueled and
  serviced small aircraft at a local airport in high school to pay for flight
  lessons and earned my pilot's license when I was seventeen.  I like to hike
  and to rock climb, to play frisbee and to canoe.  I like card games and board
  games (and word games, too).
