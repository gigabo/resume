Hi,

My name is Bo.  I think I might be the perfect backend developer for Gist.

I've dug around in the beta enough to get the, *ahem*, gist of it.  I'm
impressed by what's there, and I can see that plenty of interesting challenges
in data management and scalability lay ahead.

Over the last five years I've honed my skills as a developer while helping to
take an email marketing company from scrappy startup to industry powerhouse.
Along the way I've enjoyed working on challenging problems of performance,
scale and reliability and I've been fortunate to work with really smart,
interesting people.

I want to keep the challenge and to continue working with smart people, but I
want to get back to those startup roots and I want to do it in Seattle.  I like
the looks of Gist.

Please have a look at my resume (attached), and feel free to contact me with
any questions you might have.

Thanks,

Bo

PS:
Thanks for the puzzle.
I enjoy that sort of thing.
