Hi,

My name is Bo.  I think I might be the perfect developer for Gist.


Over the last five years I've honed my skills as a developer while helping to
take an E-Mail marketing company from scrappy startup to industry powerhouse.
Along the way I've enjoyed working on challenging problems of performance,
scale and reliability and I've been fortunate to work with really smart,
interesting people.

I want to get back to those startup roots, and I want to do it in Seattle.  I
like the looks of Gist.  Please have a look at my resume (attached), and feel
free to contact me with any questions you might have.

Thanks,

Bo
