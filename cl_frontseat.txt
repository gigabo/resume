Hi,

My name is Bo.  I think I might be the perfect backend web developer for
Frontseat.

My introduction to Frontseat came through your walkability app, walkscore.  It
has been invaluable to my quest for a home in Seattle that will let me transfer
my gasoline-free New York City lifestyle to the beautiful Pacific Northwest.
That is the kind of project I can get behind.

Over the last several years I've honed my skills while helping to take an
E-Mail marketing company from scrappy startup to industry powerhouse.  Along
the way I've enjoyed working on challenging problems of performance, scale and
reliability and I've been fortunate to work with really smart, interesting
people.

I want to continue all of that, but now I want to put it in the context of work
that I find meaningful.  I want to be proud of what I do not just because it's
technically excellent, but also because it makes the world a better place.

I see that magic combination in Frontseat.  I'm interested in figuring out how
I can be a part of it.  Please have a look at my resume (attached), and feel
free to contact me with any questions you might have.

Thanks,

Bo
