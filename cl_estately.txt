Hi,

My name is Bo.  I think I would make a great addition to the Estately
development team.

Over the last five years I've honed my skills as a backend developer while
helping to take an email marketing company from scrappy start-up to industry
powerhouse.  Along the way I've enjoyed working on challenging problems of
performance, scale and reliability and I've been fortunate to work with really
smart, interesting people.

I want to keep the challenge and to continue working with smart people, but I
want to get back to those startup roots and I want to do it in Seattle.  My
professional programming experience is mostly with Perl, C and JavaScript, but
I've done some work in Ruby on the "sup" email client, and enjoyed it.  I'm a
fast (voracious) learner, so I don't expect language choice to be a problem.

I'm interested in learning more about development at Estately.  Please have a
look at my resume (attached), and feel free to contact me with any questions
you might have.

Thanks,

Bo
